# Niva

Niva is a plain text writing tool. The challenge with modern editors is that editing plain text can be frustrating (bullets get auto indented etc). 

Niva is pure plain text and runs on the web. 

## Design

The UX is minimalist with a full screen editing window and a clean sidebar. 

## Sidebar 

The left sidebar contains a list of your files. 

## Writing Panel 

The middle section is a large pannel for writing that is clean and minimal. 

## Right Sidebar 

The right sidebar is for an AI assistant that can be added in v2. 

## Requirements 

- Simple plain text editor 
- Ability to save documents in memory. 
- Runs in browser 
- Minimal but beautiful UX with a focus on typography.
